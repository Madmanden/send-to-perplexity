## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder that contains `manifest.json` (the repo folder)

## Usage

### Quick Send (Last Used Prompt)
1. Navigate to any webpage
2. Click the extension icon
3. Perplexity opens with your last-used prompt (defaults to "Key Insights" on first use)

### Choose a Preset Prompt
1. Navigate to any webpage
2. Right-click anywhere on the page
3. Select one of the preset prompt options from the context menu
4. Perplexity opens in a new tab with your chosen prompt

The extension remembers your last-used prompt for quick access via the icon button.

### Customize Prompts
1. Right-click the extension icon and select "Options"
2. Add new prompts with the "Add New Prompt" button
3. Edit existing prompt titles and text
4. Drag and drop prompts to reorder them
5. Delete prompts you don't need
6. Click "Save Changes" to apply
7. Use "Reset to Defaults" to restore the original 7 prompts

Note: every prompt row must have both a title and prompt text before you save. Delete any row you do not want to keep.

### Omnibox Search (Address Bar)
Type `p` + Tab in the Chrome address bar, then:
- `your query` - Search Perplexity normally
- `r your query` - Search Reddit only (adds `site:reddit.com`)

Omnibox searches update the current active tab.

Examples:
- `p best coffee shops` → Searches Perplexity for "best coffee shops"
- `p r best coffee shops` → Searches Reddit for "best coffee shops"

## Files

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration (Manifest V3)
- `constants.js` - Shared constants and default prompts
- `prompt-state.js` - Shared prompt lookup and fallback helpers
- `perplexity.js` - Shared Perplexity URL/query builder used by the background script and omnibox search
- `background.js` - Service worker (main functionality, context menus, storage)
- `options.html` / `options.js` - Options page for customizing prompts

## Privacy

This extension:
- Only accesses the current tab's URL when you explicitly use it
- Stores your prompts and last-used prompt locally in your browser only
- Does not send data to any server except Perplexity (via URL parameters)
- Does not use Perplexity's API
- No telemetry, analytics, or tracking of any kind
- All data stays on your device

## Troubleshooting

- If you try to run the extension on a non-`http(s)` page (for example `chrome://extensions`), the extension will refuse to run and briefly show a `!` badge on the toolbar icon.
- If the generated query becomes too long, the extension safely truncates the content to stay within URL length limits for both quick send and omnibox searches.
